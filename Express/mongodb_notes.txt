    -> show collections. (showing the collections present in the database.)

    -> db.col.find()  (to check documents inside the collection.)
                      (here col represents collections.)
                      (in find() you can give condition to check specific data using {}.) 
                      ({} -> represents object that is key and value pair)

    -> db.col.insert() (to insert the data inside the collection)
                       (in insert you specify condition to insert data into specific field, using {})
                       ({} -> represents object that is key and value pair)
